Title: A Mixed Malay-English Language COVID-19 Twitter Dataset: A Sentiment Analysis

Manually annotated sentiment dataset for the above research paper.

Datasets	                           
3 class [negative, positive, neutral]	                   
2 class [negative, (positive+neutral)]	                    

Dataset Release Constraint
==========================
The dataset is available on GitHub and is released in compliance with the Twitter's Terms and Conditions, 
under which we are unable to publicly release the text of the collected tweets. We are, therefore, 
releasing the Tweet IDs, which are unique identifiers tied to specific tweets. The Tweet IDs can be used 
by researchers to query Twitter API and obtain the complete tweet object, including tweet content (text, 
URLs, hashtags, etc) and authorsâ€™ metadata. The process to extract the full tweet object from Twitter 
using a Tweet ID is referred to as hydration. There are several easy-to-use tools that have been 
developed for such purposes, including the Hydrator and Twarc, but one could also directly use 
Tweepy, a python library for connecting to Twitter API to extract the desired data.
